        Raised in Hillsborough, North Carolina, just outside of the Research
        Triangle Park, I have always had a natural affinity for science and
        mathematics. Trained as a chemist at Harvard University, I initially
        sought a career in the research sciences with a focus on protein
        biochemistry. However, a few years into completing my PhD in Biophysics
        at Stanford University, I realized that bench science was not the path I
        wished to pursue. I had always been curious about computer science, so I
        decided to enroll in a class at Stanford for some extracurricular fun. 3
        courses later, I realized I enjoyed the rigorous problem solving and
        creativity that software engineering requires. After graduating, I
        became a Google Tech Career Training Fellow to further build upon my
        existing coding base and enter the tech field.

        Although I like to work hard, I also have a wide variety of hobbies. As
        the daughter of an immigrant, I know how important it is to have a
        global understanding of the world and all of its people. I love to
        travel and have been to over 15 countries, including China, Germany,
        Trinidad & Tobago, and Morocco. I spent a year teaching English in Spain
        and spent a week in Beijing competing in a high school science
        competition.

        I love hiking and running long distances. After graduating with my PhD
        in 2021, I spent 5 months on the Continental Divide Trail hiking from
        Canada to Mexico, with a large portion of the trip spent hiking alone. I
        climbed countless mountains, saw 4 bears (including 2 grizzly bears),
        and made enough memories to last a lifetime. In March of 2022, I
        completed my first marathon and have plans to do many more.

        As a creative person, I love engaging in the arts. During 2020, I taught
        myself oil painting and digital art. I also enjoy playing the electric
        guitar and attending live concerts.
