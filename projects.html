        Color by Numbers is a game that is simple and relaxing to play. The user
        selects a picture to color and then colors in the image pixel by pixel.
        A pixel can only be filled if the user has selected the color with a
        number that matches the number in that picture. An image is complete
        once all pixels are filled in.

        I created this Java application from scratch as a personal project. I
        built the application module by module, focusing on implementing each
        feature before adding complexity. To improve and build upon this
        application, I would like to generate a feature that can take in images
        and automatically create a pixelated color by numbers template.

        My Lottery Wheeler is an Android mobile app that I built using Java.
        Lottery wheeling is a strategy that allows players to create
        combinations of numbers to be played in the lottery. If the player is
        playing a pick 5 lottery game, a player will select at least 6 numbers
        to wheel. Those numbers will be combined to produce several combinations
        of 5 numbers that can be played. Depending on the number of digits
        selected, the number of combinations the player wants to generate, and
        the wheel (or combination method) the player uses, a player can be
        guaranteed a certain number of wins if a subset of their numbers are
        drawn in the lottery.
      </p>

      <p class="projectDescription">
        For example, a player wants to wheel 8 numbers. The player then selects
        wheel #53008-1. With this wheel, if 3 of the player's 8 numbers show up
        in the final lottery drawing, the player is guaranteed to match at least
        3 numbers in one of their combinations. This wheel generates 5
        combinations to play. The "1" at the end of the wheel number indicates
        one "power number" is needed to play. A power number is a number that
        appears in all combinations generated. Not all wheels require power
        numbers. The final screen of the app shows the player the combinations
        to play.

      <p class="projectDescription">
        I created this Android mobile application based off of the lottery
        wheeling system created by Gail Howard (<a
          href="https://www.smartluck.com"
          target="_blank"
          >smartluck.com</a
        >). This system can be purchased as a book or computer application.
        However, there does not yet exist a mobile app. Given that most people
        are on-the-go when purchasing lottery tickets, I thought a mobile app
        incorporating this system would be a great addition.
      </p>

      <p class="projectDescription">
        This app includes a subset of hardcoded wheels to generate the number
        combinations. To improve this app, I would incorporate an algorithm that
        can generate all of the relevant wheels. In addition, the number field
        for this app is 1-43. Every state can set their own number field for
        pick 5 games. Thus, it would be useful to choose which state you are
        playing in and provide the player with the correct number field. Lastly,
        this application uses a new activity for each screen. Creating fragments
        instead of separate activities would make this app use less memory and
        take up less space.
